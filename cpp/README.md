# CPP
Documented notes on C++.

This repo will contain all of the C++ code I write that is not a self-contained application.

All entries will be commented to highlight new concepts as they appear in as linear a fashion as I can manage.

Eventually, lesson blocks will be moved to separate header files for organizational purposes.
